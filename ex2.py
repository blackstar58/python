# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print "I could have code like this." # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# print "This won't run."
# This is the second issue we did not see!!
print "This will run."
print "This is the second line possible , so it should print properly."
