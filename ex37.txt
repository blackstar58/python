and - logical operator which states that both values are true to get a pass
del - delete operator 
from - an operator that allows specific an array or segment 
not - opposite of and , the value should not equal to what ever variable is selected
while - while this allows a function to loop while some comparison is true. 
as - function used to assign the value to variable
elif - else if , if the if statement is not true this is used as a combination of else and if 
global - this is a global varible accessible across entire script 
or - this is a comparison operator used that be used to allow either variables to be true or false to pass
with - when you have two related operations which youâ€™d like to execute as a pair, with a block of code in between
assert - used to test a condition 
else - fall back to the if conditions , if the "if" condition is false then else is executed
if - This the opening for a condition statement , if the variable is met then block of code is executed
pass - It is used when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any command or code to execute.
yield - Yield is a keyword that is used like return,except the function will return a generator
break - It terminates the current loop and resumes execution at the next statement. break is when some external condition is triggered requiring a hasty exit from a loop.
excerpt - Return some descriptive information extracted from the content found at the given URL
import - pull functions or features for another file or system
print - print the value or variabl specified on to the console 
class - A class is a way to take a grouping of functions and data and place them inside a container so you can access them with the . (dot) operator
exec -  is used for executing a dynamically created statement or program
in - This narrow variables to search into a set function of data. 
raise - without any arguments is a special use of python syntax. It means get the exception and re-raise
continue - It returns the control to the beginning of the while loop.. The continue statement rejects all the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop and moves the control back to the top of the loop
finally - The finally block is a place to put any code that must execute, whether the try-block raised an exception or not.
is - 'is' is used for object identity, it checks if objects refer to the same instance (same address in memory)
return - This function returns a value from a function. This is different from print since it is not pushed to the console
def - this is used to define a user specified function 
for - this is a comparision function , once it is fullfilled the function ends 
lambda - creation of anonymous functions (i.e. functions that are not bound to a name) at runtime, using a construct called "lambda"
try - Try is used to test a statement , if no issues are found the function end , if an issue is found and expection is thrown

numbers - 
floats -
