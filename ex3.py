# This prints out a statment about counting chickens
print "I will now count my chickens:"

# This is a combination of a statment within the quotes and a math formula after the comma 
# This order of math calculation divison first then addition. 
print "Hens", 25.0 + 30.0 / 6.0

# Same as above but this does 
print "Roosters", 100.0 - 25.0 * 3.0 % 4.0

# Just a title
print "Now I will count the eggs.:"

# Simple aritmatic calculations
print 3.0 + 2.0 + 1.0 - 5.0 + 4.0 % 2.0 - 1.0 / 4.0 + 6.0

# This is a true false question using the < than operator

# This does the mathmatical calculation for above statment

# This is a statement and a calcuation together. comma seperate the value 
print "What is 3 + 2?", 3.0 + 2.0

# Same as above this is a simple math calculation 
# This is a break out of the above calculation

# Simple statement , 5 - 7 is -2 , it will always be less that a positive number
print "Oh, that's why it's False."

# Simple statment that prints
print "How about some more."

# Simple greater than comparision  , this should return true

# This should return true , but includes a equal sign
print "Is it greater or equal?", 5.0 >= -2.0

# This should return false
